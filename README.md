# Apple's Apple Pay - An Analysis

## What Is It:

Apple Pay is arguably the leading mobile payment and digital wallet service. It allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web. It is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac.

## Why This Matters:

This is an important example of how a leading tech company is moving into consumer finance in a big way, using their existing iPhone/iPad/Mac platform and existing Apple Store relationships to gain market share. And Apple Pay is hugely successful: well over a ​billion ​Apple Pay transactions took place in the second quarter of 2018, and more mobile transactions took place that quarter using Apple Pay than PayPal.
